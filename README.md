Codes for our paper to 2025ICASSP: Two Heads Are Better Than One: Averaging along Fine-Tuning to Improve Targeted Transferability.

Our key assumption is that an AE located at the center of high-confidence (w.r.t. y<sub>t</sub>) region may transfer better across unknown models than that located near the boundary of the high-confidence region. As shown in below, without cherry-picking, the proposed AaF steers AE towards a more central region than FFT. The AEs are crafted with a Resnet50 (source model), while the planes are calculated on an ensemble of target models.
